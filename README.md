# City & Guilds HTML Report Format

The purpose of this Quarto extension is to provide a universal style with company branding for html reports.

The template includes the City & Guilds logo, a brand palette and a toggle allowing readers to select dark mode.

## Installing

Run the following from a terminal and withinyour project directory.

``` bash
quarto use template cityandguilds/cag_quarto_template
```

You will be asked whether you trust the source and then to give a name for the folder where the extension will be installed (e.g. "my_report").

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting point for your article.

You will want to add '_extensions/' and 'logos/' to your .gitignore.

## Contributing
This was very much a quick, first pass. Happy to consider tweaks and extensions via a pull request.
